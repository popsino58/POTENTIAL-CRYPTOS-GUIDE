All hands on deck, Pioneers—Today is Pi Day! 
Since Pi Network was launched 4 years ago, we’ve celebrated amazing achievements that our community and Core Team have contributed together.

In this past year alone, Pi Network has enabled an innovative Mass KYC solution to onboard millions of Pioneers without out-of-pocket cost, implemented a new dynamic mining mechanism in adherence to Pi’s meritocratic principles within supply limits, migrated millions of KYC’ed Pioneers onto the Mainnet blockchain, and enabled the Pi Platform on Mainnet while releasing many useful developer APIs and tools for ecosystem building. 

These initiatives, along with many other improvements for the Pi ecosystem and infrastructure, have helped contribute to the great productivity and progress we have had this past year. Our network has continued to grow and reached over 45 million Engaged Pioneers distributed all over the world, despite the recent unfavorable news and the difficulties of the crypto and blockchain industry as a whole. 

Together, the Core Team and Pioneers have communicated and executed on our shared priorities to build a project that reflects our common goals of a more fair, distributed network built on Pi. But there’s still much work to do!

Moving forward, we’re emphasizing what Pi Network—the Core Team, Pioneers, and community developers alike—can do together to reach the primary goals of the Enclosed Network:

Mass verification of millions of Pioneers’ identity via a native, scalable KYC solution, followed by the migration of their mobile mining balance to the Pi Mainnet

Creation of real utilities for the Pi cryptocurrency through the Pi ecosystem

The Enclosed Network goals are prerequisites for us to reach Open Network, as explained in the 2021 December Whitepaper. Achieving the Enclosed Network goals relies on all members of the Pi community. 

This Pi Day announcement is not only meant to be informative but also to inspire more collective efforts. In addition to the accomplishments we’ve all made and exciting news we’re sharing, you will find specific guidance on how Pioneers can make more diverse decentralized efforts to contribute to Pi Network and help it achieve its Enclosed Network goals faster— in the theme of “What I do for Pi”.

What the Core Team is doing
The backbone of Pi is its Pioneers. To empower those tens of millions of engaged, distributed individuals, the Core Team has been building, guiding and aligning the network components necessary for Pioneers to grow, collaborate, unleash their potential, use their talents, and diversely contribute to the shared vision of Pi. The core mining mechanism of Pi speaks to the essence of this meritocratic process of the massive Pi community’s collective efforts and the true meaning of decentralization—decentralized efforts paired with widely distributed rewards. 

In the current Enclosed Network period, the Core Team has continued to build out infrastructure and necessary features to enable Pioneers to achieve the two goals. In addition to the achievements listed above over the past year, we’re announcing today some exciting new releases that will further empower the community. 

Today’s announcement will only include the major new or recent releases. More detailed Product and Tech updates on what the Core Team has been working on for the last 3 months will be provided around the end of this quarter. 

KYC for all! 
While the network has already been providing mass KYC because the majority of the network was eligible to apply for KYC anytime they wanted, we’re making the KYC application open for all Pioneers!
