(1.a) What Is A Cryptocurrency? Basic Definition
First of all let’s go back to basics. What is a currency?

It is far more than just a banknote or coins. A currency is a unit of storage and account and a means of exсhаnge. In simple terms, it is a universally accepted way of buying or selling any goods or services.

In older times, when the barter system was in place anything from rice and grains to wool and even feathers would be considered a currency. Then came in banks to regularize this means of payment. That’s when they made coins and printed banknotes.

Now in the digital time and age, the coins and banknotes seem to become outdated. So came in a new form of currency, the cryptocurrency.

Now, What is Cryptocurrency?
It is just like a normal currency but in a digital platform and accepted universally unlike physical currencies that work only in a specific country. A single centralized platform does not bind cryptocurrencies.

(1.b) What It Is A Cryptocurrency? Advance Description
Cryptocurrencies don’t have banknotes, but they do have coins. There is also one more term, Token in cryptocurrencies. People often get confused between a token and a coin.



(2) So What exactly is the difference between a Token and a Coin in Cryptocurrency?

The three main differences are:

Coins are part of a single blockchain while tokens operate on the existing blockchains.
Tokens are limited to a specific industry or community; coins can be used anywhere.
Coins can buy tokens, but tokens can’t buy coins.
Let’s simplify using a real-life scenario. If you go to Starbucks regularly, then you may earn loyalty points for your frequent purchases. With these points, you can redeem a drink. These loyalty points are token that an establishment (in this case Starbucks) offers.

Now you can buy such loyalty points by giving money which in turn gives you free coffee. This money is the coin (in this case a real-life coin or bank note).

You can buy loyalty points using coins, but you can not get real money using loyalty points. So a crypto coin can be used to buy a business’s token, but you can’t buy a crypto coin using a token.
